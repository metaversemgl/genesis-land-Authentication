# genesis-land-Authentication
In Genesis, your real-world identity is not mandatory, you can have a whole new identity in Genesis and never reveal your true identity.
In Genesis, your limit is only your imagination, many users in the real world are severely censored by governments and even families, this is not the case in Genesis.
But in order for us in Genesis to be sure that you are the real owner of the land, the program, even your avatar, and to want to take care of your identity in Genesis, we do it according to MGL-EA14 protocol, in which case each user has a private key. By which it can enter the Genesis land;
Genesis respects the privacy of its residents and is not mandatory for another model of authentication. If they wish, the inhabitants of the land of Genesis can apply for eye identification next to the private key to enter Genesis.
Eye-to-eye program is an application that you can use next to a private key using virtual reality glasses and a sophisticated Genesis algorithm.
